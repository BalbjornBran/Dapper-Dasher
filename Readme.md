Dasher-Dapper game
By Balbjorn Bran

This is another simple game, just to learn how to create structs, creations of 
functions, Loops and more basic stuff.

This is a typical 2D game with just a character running in the world. The player
must jump using space to avoid some nebulas.
If the player touches the nebulas, the game will restart. If the player reaches 
the latest nebula, he will win.

There is an .rar file if you want to download to play. Or you can download the
project and open it using the -worspace file and opening it with visual code.
